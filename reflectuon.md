Reflection
======================

I learned new functions that I can use for future projects. The main piece that I learned in regards to function was the new way I can handle the keyPressed function. Before I thought that the best way to use the function was to call it and then code what each key did individually. What I learned was that I could call keyPressed and tell it that if a key in the dispatch is pressed, then it will read what the function assigned to that key does and run that. I enjoyed this new way because it made the code look cleaner. I also was reminded of loops and how they work. I used loops a lot in this project in order to find x and y values of the picture, so that it could be manipulated. I wouldn't say that I learned how they worked, but instead, it was a refresher for me. I struggled to make my pixelate function work at first, but with the help of Luke, I was able to get it to work. The only problem is that it does not overlap the original image and it does not reset. I know that this problem is related to me drawing a completely new image in order to manipulate it, but I was unable to get it working.
